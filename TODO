TODO for Devil's Pie

A nearly-ordered list:
* More matchers (can't think of any though)
* More actions (set size, set position)
* SGML catalogue entry
* Catch events on window move and resize too
* Clean up and order the souce tree. devilspie and the editor should
  be seperate directories, and the sample configuration file (etc)
  should not be in the top-level directory.
* Add ability to insert self into session on startup
* GUI builder
* RedHat packages
* Remove dependency on gnome-common, as using it breaks builds on RH8
  (they forgot to package it) and this program only requires GTK+ and
  libwnck.
* Use gnome-vfs to monitor the configuration file, and re-read it when
  it is changed. This is fairly trivial, props to the gnome-vfs guys.

The position of GUI builder is not a reflection of how much I want
one, but a reflection of how long I think a good config tool will take
to write.

My previous GUI builders have been rather advanced... maybe it should
be more wizard like. Allow the user to select one of a series of
common options, such as 'make this window not appear in the task list'
or 'move this window to workspace "Foo"'.
