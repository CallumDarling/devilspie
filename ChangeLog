	* src/devilspie.c: Abort the Flurb if there are no matchers. Patch
	from Patrick Aussems <zyk@bugfactory.org>.

	* src/devilspie-matcher-windowname.gob: Fix a segfault when
	passing in NULL pointers as strings. Patch from Patrick Aussems
	<zyk@bugfactory.org>.

	* .cvsignore, src/.cvsignore, po/.cvsignore: Added CVS ignore
	files, from Patrick Aussems.

	* configure.in: Add GNOME_COMPILE_WARNINGS, defaulting to "yes".

	* src/Makefile.am: Remove the definition of CFLAGS as that was the
	Wrong Thing To Do. The above change sets the warning flags now.

	* Makefile.am: Try and remove the intltool-* files which are
	generated. For some reason this doesn't work...

2002-11-10  Ross Burton  <ross@burtonini.com>

	* configure.in: Bump version up to 0.2.4. Also check for the
	regular expression POSIX headers, for...

	* src/devilspie-matcher-windowname.gob: Use regular expression
	matching instead of literal string compares. Thanks to Patrick
	Aussems <zyk@bugfactory.org> for this kick-arse patch.

	* src/devilspie-action-savegeometry.gob: Connect to the
	window_closed signal of the WnckScreen in the constructor.

	* README: Documentation is always a good thing. I was bored so I
	fleshed this out a little.

2002-10-24  Ross Burton  <ross@burtonini.com>

	* src/devilspie-action-debug.gob: Print out the window Role.

	* src/devilspie-action-savegeometry.gob: Started on a Save Window
	Geometry action. Doesn't do anything at the moment apart from
	printing messages at the right moments.

	* src/devilspie-matcher-windowname.gob: Re-wrote the return logic
	to be much clearer, and started on a window role (WM_WINDOW_ROLE)
	matcher, which also doesn't work.

2002-10-17  Ross Burton  <ross@burtonini.com>

	* src/devilspie-action-layer.gob: Added an Action which can set
	the ABOVE and BELOW layer hints on windows. Panel-below heaven is
	here! :)

	* src/devilspie.c: Parse the command line arguments
	correctly. Open the file specified, if no file is specified try to
	open ~/.devilspie.xml.

	* configure.in: Bump version to 0.2.2.

2002-09-08  Ross Burton  <ross@burtonini.com>

	* src/devilspie.c (main): Actually check the number of arguments,
	so that we don't coredump if no configuration file is
	specified. Fixes a segfault pointed out by jdub. As usual, IRC is
	a great way of finding bugs in code.

	* configure.in: Bump version to 0.2.1.

2002-09-03  Ross Burton  <ross@burtonini.com>

	* src/*: Many, many changes. In fact this entry is totally
	redundant, except for...

	* configure.in: Bump version up to 0.2.

2002-08-14  Ross Burton  <ross@burtonini.com>

	* src/*: Finally managed to make enough work for an alpha
	release. Release 0.1!
