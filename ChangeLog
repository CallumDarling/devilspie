	* configure.in: Add GNOME_COMPILE_WARNINGS, defaulting to "yes".

	* src/Makefile.am: Remove the definition of CFLAGS as that was the

2002-11-12  Ross Burton  <ross@burtonini.com>

	* Makefile.am: Try and remove the intltool-* files which are
	generated. For some reason this doesn't work...

2002-11-10  Ross Burton  <ross@burtonini.com>

	* configure.in: Bump version up to 0.2.4. Also check for the
	regular expression POSIX headers, for...

	* src/devilspie-action-debug.gob: Print out the window Role.

	Geometry action. Doesn't do anything at the moment apart from
	printing messages at the right moments.

2002-09-08  Ross Burton  <ross@burtonini.com>

	* src/devilspie.c (main): Actually check the number of arguments,
	so that we don't coredump if no configuration file is
	specified. Fixes a segfault pointed out by jdub. As usual, IRC is
	a great way of finding bugs in code.

	* configure.in: Bump version to 0.2.1.

2002-09-03  Ross Burton  <ross@burtonini.com>

	* src/*: Many, many changes. In fact this entry is totally

	release. Release 0.1!
